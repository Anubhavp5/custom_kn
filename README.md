### ABSTRACT

Online Food Ordering System project is aimed at developing a complete online food ordering
system for use in the food service industry which will allow the restaurants to quickly and
easily manage an online menu which customer can browse and use to place orders with just a
few clicks. The customers will have to choose whether they want to do payment online or cash
on delivery.

The customer will be in a position to view the products, register and place an order. Online
Food Ordering is a form of electronic shopping store where is directly online to the seller’s
computer usually via the Internet. There is no intermediary service. The sale and purchase
transaction is completely electronically and interactively in real-time. The development of this
new system contains the following activities, which try to develop on-line application by
keeping the entire process in the view of database integration approach. User gets their email
id and password to access their account.

This Online Food Ordering System is proposed here which simplifies the food ordering
process. The proposed system shows a user interface and update the menu with all available
options so that it eases the customer work. Customer can choose more than one item to make
an order and can view order details.

The order confirmation is sent to the customer. The placed order status can be seen and updated
in the database and returned in real time. This study identifies how web application can be
utilized to provide food services to the customers and to understand the potential of web
application in the business environment.

**INTRODUCTION**

### 1.1 ONLINE FOOD ORDERING SYSTEM

In today’s age of fast food and take-out, many restaurants have chosen to focus on quick
preparation and speedy delivery of orders rather than offering a rich dining experience. Until
very recently, all these deliveries were placed over the phone, but there are many disadvantages
to this system, including the inconvenience of the customer needing to have a physical copy of
the menu, lack of a visual confirmation that the order was placed correctly, and the necessity
for the restaurant to have an employee answering the phone and taking orders. In this
technological age it is very difficult for any organization to survive without utilizing
technology.

There is a lot of scope online food ordering business, and we can tap it to the max extent
possible as everyone has access to an online food facility via the internet. Food business usually
will have a high demand and hence online business prospect for food ordering should be
profitable.

So the ONLINE FOOD ORDERING SYSTEM, which is a technique of ordering foods online
is applicable in any food delivery industry. The main advantage of my system is that it greatly
simplifies the ordering process for both the customers and our restaurant. When the customer
visits the our restaurant webpage, they are presented in an interactive and up-to-date menu,
complete with all available options and dynamically adjusting prices based on the selected
options.

After making a selection, the item is then added to their order, which the customer can also
review the details of at any time before checking out. This provides visual confirmation of what
was selected and ensures that items in the order are, in fact, what was intended. Within this
application, all items in the order are displayed, along with their corresponding options and
delivery details, in a concise and easy to read manner.

## 1.2 SCOPE OF THE PROJECT

Online food ordering system will be a web-based application whose main language of
programming will be HTML. Its main aim to simplify and improve the efficiency of the
ordering process for both customer and our restaurant, minimize manual data entry and ensure
data accuracy and security during order placement process. Customer will also be able to view
product meus and their ingredients and be able to have a visual confirmation that the order was
place correctly.

**2. SYSTEM STUDY**

### 2.1 EXISTING SYSTEM:

The existing system is inconvenient for customer needing to have a physical copy of the menu,
its time consuming, there is lack of visual confirmation that the order was placed correctly or
not, Restaurants have to have an employee answering the phone and taking orders all the time
which increases manual work and paper work. And there is also a huge difficulty in tracking
customers past history and lack of data security.

The current System of a company is very ancient and need to be replacing as companies
business is expanding. One of the biggest disadvantages of the current system is that lacking
of computerized food order each time a customer need to order food he has to wait for the
waiter to take their order and then give to the chef who will be preparing our food. So this
process is very time consuming and very ancient.

This is very difficult to manage. And there also situations where the customers mixes the order
and gives food of one customer to another and there are also situations where customer forgets
to take the order and even after taking the order he forgets to supply food on time.

All the existing system is traditional and lack of use of technology, therefore the process is very
time and lengthy as paper work is there. This was creating problem in maintain data record at
the end like employee attendance, bill, pay slip, salary slip etc.

**Limitation of Existing System**

1) As it is not online the customers have to wait for the waiter to take their order and have to
wait for the food as well

2) Waiters have to manually keep a record of all the food ordered by the customer and that
work is very complicated.

3) Waiters have to manually calculate the amount of money to be paid by the customer after
having food.

4) Records are maintained manually so there are chances of damage and loss of data.

5) Less exposure for people in the world of technology.

## 2.2 PROPOSED SYSTEM

In the proposed system Security of data is provided where data are well protected for personal
use and also ensures data accuracy during order placement process. It minimizes manual data
entry. Since the data processing is very fast it provides great efficiency. This proposed system
is user friendly and provides interactive interface with provision for customer to view menus.

It greatly simplifies the ordering process for both customer and restaurant. This online
application enables the end users to register online, select the food from the e-menu card, read
the E-menu card and order food online by just selecting the food that the user want to have.
The results after selecting the food from the E-menu card will directly appear in the screen. By
using this application the work of the Waiter is reduced and we can also say that the work is
nullified.

The benefit of this is that if there is rush in the Restaurant then there will be chances that the
waiters will be unavailable and the users can directly order the food to the chef online by using
this application. The user will be given a username and a password, by sing that every time a
user logs in. This implies that the customer is the regular user of the Restaurant.

**Benefits of proposed system:**

1) As it is online the customer doesn't have to wait for the waiter to take their order and
doesn't us to wait for the food as well

2) Waiters don't have to manually keep a record of all the food ordered by the customer and
that work is very easy.

3) Waiters don't have to manually calculate the amount of money to be paid by the customer
after having food it is automatically done in the software.

4) Records are maintained in computers so there are less chances of damage and loss of data

5) More exposure for people in the world of technology.

**Requirement Specification:**

The website is designed in order to access the information one has to produce one's identity by
entering the user-id and password. Every user has their own domain of access beyond which
the access is dynamically refrained rather denied.

**Need for computerization**

The increasing complexity of services and hence the large quantities of information necessary
to be maintained by modern day cyber company has made the computerization of the front
office system a necessity, and this system is specifically designed for the owner in mind as the
end user.

### ADVANTAGES

- Easy to use.
- Provides more functionality.
- Provides more information.

## 2.3 IMPLEMENTATION

Implementation is the stage where the theoretical design is turned into a working system. Once
the design is complete, most of the major decisions about the system have been made. The goal
of coding phase is to translate the design of the system into code in a given programming
language. For a given design, the aim in this phase is to implement the design in the best
possible manner.

The coding phase affects both testing and maintenance profoundly. Since the testing and
maintenance costs of software are much higher than the coding cost, the goal of the coding
should be to reduce the testing and maintenance effort. Hence, during coding the focus should
be on developing the programs that are easy to read and understand, and not simply on
developing programs that are easy to write.

The implementation stage consists of

- Making the necessary changes of the system as desired by the user
- Training the user personal prior to the implementation of two steps shown below as to the
    carried out.
- Testing the developed programs with the sample data.
- Detection and correction of errors.

## 2.4 FEASIBILITY STUDY

After doing the project Online Wedding Planner, study and analyzing all the existing or
required functionalities of the system, the need task is to do the feasibility study for the project.
All projects are feasible given unlimited resources and infinite time. Feasibility study includes
consideration of all the possible ways to provide a solution to the given problem. The proposed
solution should satisfy all the user requirements and should be flexible enough so that future
changes can be easily done based on the future upcoming requirements.

- **Economical Feasibility**

This is a very important aspect to be considered while developing a project. We decided the
technology based on minimum possible cost factor.

➢ All hardware and software cost has to be borne by the organization.
➢ Overall we have estimated that the benefits the organization is going to receive from the
proposed system will surely overcome the initial costs and the later on running cost for
system.

- **Technical Feasibility**

This included the study of function, performance and constraints that may affect the ability to
achieve an acceptable system. For this feasibility study, we studied complete functionality to
be provided in the system as described in the System. Requirement Specification (SRS), and
checked if everything was possible using different type of frontend and backend platforms.

- **Operational Feasibility**

No doubt the proposed system is fully GUI based that is very user friendly and all inputs to be
taken all self-explanatory even to a layman. Besides, a proper training has been conducted to
let know the essence of the system to the users so that they feel comfortable with new system.
As far our study is concerned the clients are comfortable and happy as the system has cut down
their loads and doing.

```
**3.LITERATURE SURVEY**

**TOOL SURVEY**

**3.1 PHP, HTML AND MYSQL**

PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out
how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994.

- PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Pre-processor".
- PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage
    dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.
- It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MYSQL, Posture SQL,
    Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server
- PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache module
    on the UNIX side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries
- with huge result sets in record-setting time.
- PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and LDAP. PHP
    added support for Java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making
- n-tier development a possibility for the first time.
- PHP is forgiving: PHP language tries to be as forgiving as possible.
- PHP Syntax is C-Like.

**Common uses of PHP:**

- PHP performs system functions, i.e. from files on a system it can create, open, read, write,
    and close them.
- PHP can handle forms, i.e. gather data from files, save data to a file, thru email you can
    Send data, return data to the user.
- You add, delete, and modify elements within your database thru PHP.
- Access cookies variables and set cookies.
- Using PHP, you can restrict users to access some pages of your website.
- It can encrypt data

**Characteristics of PHP**

Five important characteristics which makes PHP's practical nature possible:

- Simplicity
- Efficiency
- Security
- Flexibility
- Familiarity


```

```
**PHP is whitespace insensitive:**

Whitespace is the stuff you type that is typically invisible on the screen, including spaces, tabs,
and carriage returns (end-of-line characters).

PHP whitespace insensitive means that it almost never matters how many whitespace
characters you have in a row one whitespace character is the same as many such characters.

**Statements are expressions terminated by semicolons:**

A statement in PHP is any expression that is followed by a semicolon (). Any sequence of
valid PHP statements that is enclosed by the PHP tags is n valid PHP program. Here is a
typical statement in PHP, which in this case assigns a string of characters to a variable called
greeting.

### 3.2 HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE (HTML)

The Hyper Text Mark-up Language (HTML) is a simple mark-up language used to create
hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML documents are
SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information
from a wide range of applications. A set of instructions embedded in a document is called Mark-
up Language. These instructions describe what the document text means and how it should
look in display.

Hyper Text Mark-up Language (HTML) is the language used to encode World Wide Web
documents and is a document lay out and Hyperlink specification language that defines the
syntax and placement of special embedded directions aren't displayed by a web browser, but
tells it how to display the contents of the documents including text, images and other supported
media.

Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML), the languages of the World Wide Web (WWW), allows
users to produces Web pages that include text, graphics and pointer to other Web pages
(Hyperlinks). To publish information for global distribution, one needs a universally
understood language, a kind of publishing mother tongue that all computers may potentially
understand. The publishing language used by the World Wide Web is HTML (Hyper Text Mark-
up Language).

HTML gives authors he means to publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists,
photos, etc. Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button Design
forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information,
making reservations, ordering products etc. Include spreadsheets, video clips, sound clips, and
other applications directly in their documents.

### USES OF HTML:

Web site is a collection of pages, publication, and documents that reside on web server. While
these page, publication and a document as a formatted in any single format you should use
HTML for home page and all primary pages and the site. This will enable the millions of web
users it considered first for formatting any new material you plan to publish on the web HTML
documents are platform independent, meaning that they don't conform to any standard if they
are created properly you can move home page to any server platform or you can access them
with any complaint www browser.

### BASIC HTML TAGS:

The first tag in your HTML document is <html>. This tag tells your browser that this is the
start of an HTMI. document. The last tag in your document is </html>. This tag tells your
browser that this is the end of the HTMI. document. The text between the title tags is the title
of your document. The title is displayed in your browser's caption. The text between the <body>
tags is the text that will be displayed in your browser. The text between the <b> and </b> tags
will be displayed in a bold font. When you save an HTML file, you can use either the htm or
the html extension. There are several features in HTML that helps in performing major
operation for the database.

<!-- --> specifies comments

<A>............<A> creates hypertext links

<B>............</B> Formats text as bold

<BIG>.........</BIG> Formats text in large font

<BODY>.....</BODY> Contains all tags and text in the HTML document

<CENTER>....</CENTER> Creates text

<DD>.......</DD> Definition of a term

<DL>......</DL> Creates definition list

<FONT>.....</FONT> Formats text with a particular font

<FORM>.....</FORM> Encloses a fill-out form

<FRAME>....</FRAME> Defines a particular frame in a set of frames

<H#>......</H#> Creates headings of different levels(1-61)

<HEAD>.....</HEAD> Contains tags that specify information about a document

<HR>.......</HR> Creates a horizontal rule


```
Page | 14
```
<HTML>.....</HTML> Contains all other HTML tags

<META>.....</META> Provides meta-information about a document

<SCRIPT>......</SCRIPT> Contains clients-side or server-side script

<TABLE>......</TABLE> Creates a table

<TD>.......</TD> Indicates table data in a table

<TR>.....</TR> Designates a table row

<TR>...</TR> Creates a heading in a table

### ATTRIBUTES

The attributes of an element are name-value pairs, separated by "", and written within the start
label of an element, after the element's me. The value should be enclosed in single or double
quotes, although values consisting of certain characters can be left unquoted in HTML (but not
XHTML).Leaving attribute values unquoted is considered unsafe.

Most elements take any of several common attributes; id, class, style and title. Most also take
language-related attributes: Lang and dir.

The id attribute provides a document-wide unique identifier for an element. This can be used
by style sheets to provide presentational properties, by browsers to focus attention on the
specific element or by scripts to alter the contents or presentation of an element. The class
attribute provides a way of classifying similar elements for presentation purposes. For example.
nn HTML document (or a set of documents) may use the designation class "notation" to
indicate that all elements with this class value are all subordinate to the main text of the
document for documents). Such notation classes of elements might be gathered together and
presented as footnotes on a page, rather than appearing in the place where they appear in the
source IITMI.

An author may use the style non-attributable codes presentational properties to a particular
element. It is considered better practice to use an element's son id page and select the element
with a style sheet, though sometimes this can be too cumbersome for a simple ad ho application
of styled properties.

The title is used to attach subs textual explanation to an element In most browsers this title
attribute is displayed as what is often referral to as a tooltip. The generic inline span element
can be used to demonstrate these various non-attributes.

The preceding displays as IITMI. (pointing the cursor at the abbreviation should display the
title text in most browsers).


```

```
**Designing Documents with HTML**

The following general principles are observed when working with HTML

1. Separate Structure and Presentation

HTML has its roots in SGML, which has always been a language for the specification of
structural mark-up. As HTML, matures more and more of its presentational elements and
attributes are being replaced by other mechanisms, in particular style sheets. Experience has
shown that separating the structure of a document from its presentational aspects reduces the
cost of serving a wide range of platforms, media, etc., and facilities document revision.


```

```
2. Accessibility to the Universal Wide Web:

To make the web more accessible to everyone, notably those with disabilities, authorsshould
consider how their documents, may be rendered on a variety of platforms, speech-based
browsers, readers, etc. We do not recommend that designers limit their creativity, only that they
consider alternate renderings in their design. HTML offers a number of mechanisms to this
end (e.g., the alt attribute, the access key attributes, etc).

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "THIS IS AN EXAMPLE">

<HTML>

<HEAD>

<TITLE>YOUR TITLE GOES HERE</TITLE>

</HEAD>

<BODY>

YOUR MAIN INFORMATION GOES HERE.

</BODY>

</HTML>

### 3.3 SQL SERVER DATABASE

A database management, or DBMS, gives the user access to their data and helps them transform
the data into information. Such database management systems include dBase, paradox, IMS,
SQL Server and SQL Server. These systems allow users to create, update and extract
information from their database.

A database is a structured collection of data. Data refers to the characteristics of people, things
and events. SQL Server stores cach data item in its own fields. In SQL Server, the fields relating
to a particular person, thing or event are bundled together to form a single complete unit of
data, called a record (it can also be referred to as raw or an occurrence). Each record is made
up of a number of fields. No two fields in a record can have the same field name.

During an SQL Server Database design project, the analysis of your business needs identifies
all the fields or attributes of interest. If your business needs change over time, you define any
additional fields or change the definition of existing fields.

**SQL Server Tables:**

SQL Server stores records relating to each other in a table. Different tables are created for the
various groups of information. Related tables are grouped together to form a database.


```
Page | 17
```
**Primary Key:**

Every table in SQL Server has a field or a combination of fields that uniquely identifies record
in the table. The Unique identifier is called the Primary Key, or simply the Key. The primary
key provides the means to distinguish one record from all other in a table. It allows the user
and the database system to identify, locate and refer to one particular record in the database.

**Relational Database:**

Sometimes all the information of interest to a business operation can be stored in one table.
SQL Server makes it very easy to link the data in multiple tables. Matching an employee to the
department in which they work is one example. This is what makes SQL Server a relational
database management system, or RDBMS. It stores data in two or more tables and enables you
to define relationships between the tables and enables you to define relationships between the
tables.

**Foreign Key:**

When a field is one table matches the primary key of another field is referred to as a foreign
key. A foreign key is a field or a group of fields in one table whose values match those of the
primary key of another table.

**Referential Integrity**

Not only does SQL Server allow you to link multiple tables, it also maintains consistency
between them. Ensuring that the data among related tables is correctly matched is referred to
as maintaining referential integrity.

**Data Abstraction**

A major purpose of a database system is to provide users with an abstract view of thedata. This
system hides certain details of how the data is stored and maintained. Data abstraction is
divided into three levels.

1. **Physical level:** This is the lowest level of abstraction at which one describes how the
    data are actually stored.
2. **Conceptual Level:** At this level of database abstraction all the attributed and what data
    are actually stored is described and entries and relationship among them.
3. **View level:** This is the highest level of abstraction at which one describes only part of
    the database.


```

```
**Advantages of RDBMS**

- Redundancy can be avoided
- Inconsistency can be eliminated
- Data can be Shared
- Standards can be enforced
- Security restrictions can be applied
- Integrity can be maintained
- Conflicting requirements can be balanced Data independence can be achieved.

**Disadvantages of DBMS**

A significant disadvantage of the DBMS system is cost. In addition to the cost of purchasing
of developing the software, the hardware has to be upgraded to allow for the extensive
programs and the workspace required for their execution and storage. While centralization
reduces duplication, the lack of duplication requires that the database be adequately backed up
so that in case of failure the data can be recovered.

### FEATURES OF SQL SERVER (RDBMS)

SQL SERVER is one of the leading database management systems (DMS) because it is the
only Database that meets the uncompromising requirements of today's most demanding
information systems. SQL Server leads the industry in both performance and capability From
complex decision support systems (DSS) to the most rigorous online transaction processing
(OLTP) application, even application that require simultaneous DSS and OLTP access to the
same eritical detail.

SQL SERVER is a truly portable, distributed, and open DDMS that delivers unmatched
performance, continuous operation and support for every database.

SQL SERVER RDBMS is high performance falt tolerant DUMS which is specially designed
for online transactions processing and for handling large database application.

SQL SERVER with transactions processing option offers two features which contribute to very
high level of transaction processing throughput, which are the row level lock manager.

**Enterprise wide Data Sharing**

The unrivalled portability and connectivity of the SQL SERVER DOMS enables all the systems
in the organization to be linked into a singular, integrated computing resource


```
Page | 19
```
**Portability:**

SQL SERVER is fully portable to more than 80 distinct hardware and operating systems
platforms, including UNIX, MSDOS, OS 2. Macintosh and dozens of proprietary platformis.
This portability gives complete freedom to choose the database server platform that meets the
system requirements.

**Open Systems:**

SQL SERVER offers a leading implementation of industry-standard SQL, SQL Server's open
architecture integrates SQL SERVER and non-SQL SERVER DBMS with industry's most
comprehensive collection of tools, application, and third party software products SQL Server's
Open architecture provides transparent access to data from other relational database and even
non-relational database.

**Distributed Data Sharing**

SQL Server's networking and distributed database capabilities to access data stored on remote
server with the same case as if the information was stored on a single local computer. A single
SQL statement can access data at multiple sites. You can store data where system requirements
such as performance, security or availability dictate Unmatched Performance The most
advanced architecture in the industry allows the SQL SERVER DBMS to deliver unmatched
performance.

**Sophisticated Concurrency Control**

Real World applications demand access to critical data. With most database Systems
application becomes "contention bound"- which performance is limited not by the CPU power
or by disk I/O, but user waiting on one another for data access. SQL Server employs full,
unrestricted row-level locking and contention free queries to minimize and in many cases
entirely eliminates contention wait times.

**No I/O Bottlenecks**

SQL Server's fast commit groups commit and deferred write technologies dramatically reduce
disk I/O bottlenecks. While some database write whole data block to disk at commit time, SQL
Server commits transactions with at most sequential log file on disk at commit time, On high
throughput systems, one sequential writes typically group commit multiple transactions. Data
read by the transaction remains as shared memory so that other transactions may access that
data without reading it again from disk. Since fast commits write all data necessary to the
recovery to the log file, modified blocks are written back to the database independently of the
transaction commit, when written from memory to disk.

**SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS**

## 5.1 SRS-SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION

Software requirements specification (SRS) is a description of a software system to be
developed, laying out functional and non-functional requirements, and may include a set of use
cases that describe interactions the users will have with the software requirements specification
establishes the basis for an agreement between customers and contractors or suppliers (in
market-driven projects, these roles may be played by the marketing and development divisions)
on what the software product is to do as well as what it is not expected to do.

Software requirements specification permits a rigorous assessment of requirements before
design can begin and reduces later redesign. It should also provide a realistic basis for
estimating product costs, risks, and schedules. The software requirements specification
document enlists enough and necessary requirements that are required for the project
development.

## 5.2 NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Non-functional requirement is a requirement that specifies criteria that can be used to judge the
operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors. Functional requirements define what a
system is supposed to do whereas non-functional requirements define how a system is supposed
to be. The non-functional requirements are the constraints or the environment in which the
software is developed.

**Reliability:** It is the ability of a person or system to perform and maintain its
functions in routine circumstances, as well as hostile or unexpected
circumstances. The application manages to perform all the functionalities well.

**Security :** It is regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use of the product
or prevention of the data used or created by the product. Define any user identity
authentication requirements.

**Usability:** The word "ability" also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use duringthe
design process.

**Interoperability :** It is a property referring to the ability of diverse system and ins to work
together (inter-operate).

## 5.3 SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION

Implementation is the stage in the project where the theoretical design is turned into a working
system. The implementation phase constructs, installs and operates the new system. The most
crucial stage in achieving a new successful system is that it will work efficiently and effectively.
There are several activities involved while implementing a new project. They are

End user training

- End user Education
- Training on the application software
- System Design
- Parallel Run and To New System
- Post implementation Review

**End user Training:**

The successful implementation of the new system will purely upon the involvement of the
officers working in that department. The officers will be imparted the necessary training on the
new technology.

**End User Education** :

The education of the end user start after the implementation and testing is over. When the
system is found to be more difficult to understand and complex, more effort is put to educate
the end used to make them aware of the system, giving them lectures about the new system and
providing them necessary documents and materials about how the system can do this.

**Training of application software:**

After providing the necessary basic training on the computer awareness, the users will have to
be trained upon the new system such as the screen flows and screen design type of help on the
screen, type of errors while entering the data, the corresponding validation check at each entry
and the way to correct the data entered. It should then cover information needed by the specific
user or group to use the system.

**Post Implementation View:**

The department is planning a method to know the states of the past
implementation process. For that regular meeting will be arranged by the
concerned officers about the implementation problem and success.

### 5.5 TOOLS & TECHNOLOGICAL SURVEY

### UNDERSTANDING HTML

- HTML was originated by Tim Berners-Lee.
- HTML developed a few years ago as a subset of SGML (Standard Generalized Mark-up
    Language), which is a higher-level mark-up language that has long been a favorite of the
    Department of Defense.
- Any HTML document is also valid for SGML.
- HTML is a Hyper Text Markup Language that is used to develop web pages.
- HTML is not a programming language like C, C++ and Java etc.
- It is a cross platform markup language that is design to be flexible enough to display text
    and other elements like graphical on a variety of views
- The HTML documents consists of special Tags that are embedded in an ASCII
- document.
- Web browser like Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator etc., interprets these Tags

**About JavaScript**

**What is JavaScript?**

- JavaScript was designed to add interactivity to HTML pages.
- JavaScript is a scripting language (a scripting language is a lightweight programming
    language)
- A JavaScript consists of lines of executable computer code
- A JavaScript is usually embedded directly into HTML page.
- JavaScript is an interpreted language (means that scripts execute without preliminary
    compilation)
- Everyone can use JavaScript without purchasing a license


```
Page | 27
```
**Are Java and JavaScript the Same?**

NO! Java and JavaScript are two completely different languages in hot concept and design!
Java (developed by Sun Microsystems) is a powerful and much more complex programming
language - in the same category as C and C++)

**What can a JavaScript Do?**

JavaScript gives HTML designers a programming tool - HTML authors are normally not
programmers, but JavaScript is a scripting language with a very simple syntax! Almost anyone
can put small "snippets" of code into their HTML pages.

**JavaScript Syntax.**

- Unlike HTML, JavaScript is case sensitive.
- Dot Syntax is used to combine terms e.g., document .write("Hello World")
- Certain characters terms are reserved.
- JavaScript is simple text (ASCII).

**JavaScript Terminology**

- JavaScript programming uses specialized terminology.
- Understanding JavaScript terms is fundamental to understanding the script.
- Objects, Properties, Methods, Events, Functions, Values, Variables ,Expressions,
    Operators.

**5.6 INTRODUCTION TO PHP:**

- The full form of PHP is "Hypertext Preprocessor". Its original name was "Personal Home
    Page"
- Rasmus Lerdorf software engineer, Apache team member is the creator and original driving
    force behind PHP. The first part of PHP was developed for his personal use in late 1994.
- By the middle of 1997, PHP was being used on approximately 50,000 sites worldwide.
- PHP is server-side scripting language, which can be embedded in HTML used as a a stand-
    alone.
- PHP doesn't do anything about what a page looks and sounds like. In fact .most of what
    PHP does is invisible to the end user.
- Someone looking at a PHP page will not necessarily be able to tell that it was not written
    purely in HTML., because usually the result of PHP is HTML
- PHP is an official module of Apache HTTP Server.
- PHP is fully cross-platform, meaning it runs native on several levels of Units.
    as well as on Windows and now on Mac OS X.


```
Page | 28
```
**Advantages of PHP**

- Cost: PHP costs you nothing. It is open source software and doesn't need topurchase it for
    development.
- Ease of Use: PHP is easy to learn, compared to the others. A lot of Ready- made PHP scripts
    are freely available in market so, you can use them in yourproject or get some help from
    them.
- HTML-Support: PHP is embedded within HTML; In other words, PHP pages are ordinary
    HTML pages that escape into PHP mode only when necessary. When a client requests this
    page, the web server preprocesses it.
- This means it goes through the page from top to bottom, looking for sectionsof PHP, which
    it will try to resolve.
- Cross-platform compatibility: MySQL run native on every popular flavor of Unix and
    windows. A huge percentage PHP and of the world's HTTP servers run on one of these two
    classes of operating system.
- PHP is compatible with the three leading Web servers: Apache HTTP Server
- for Unix and Windows, Microsoft Internet Information Server, and Netscape Enterprise
    Server. It also works with several lesser-known servers, including Alex Blits httpd.
    Microsoft's Personal Web Server, AOL Server and Omni centrix's Omni server application
    server.

**Stability** :

The word stable means two different things in this context:

- The server doesn't need to be rebooted often
- The software doesn't change radically and incompatibly from
- release to release.

**To our advantage, both of these apply to both MySQL and PHP.**

**Speed:** PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as and Apache
module on the Unix side. Although it takes a slight performance hit by being interpreted rather
than compiled, this is far outweighed by the benefits PHP drives from its status as a Web server
module.

## 5.7 INTRODUCTION TO SQL SERVER

Microsoft SQL Server is a full-featured relational database management system(RDBMS) that
offers a variety of administrative tools to ense the burdens of database development,
maintenance and administration. In this article, we'll cover six of the more frequently used
tools: Enterprise Manager, Query Analyzer, SQL Profiler, Service Manager, Data

**Transformation Services and Books Online.**

- SQL Server Management Studio includes the following general features:
- Supports most administrative tasks for SQL Server.
- A single. integrated environment for SQL Server Database Engine management and
    authoring.
- Dialogs for managing objects in the SQL Server Database Engine, Analysis Services, and
    Reporting Services, that allows you to execute your actions immediately, send them to a
    Code Editor, or script them for later execution.
- Non-modal and resizable dialogs allow access to multiple tools while a dialog is open. A
    common scheduling dialog that allows you to perform action of the management dialogs at
    a later time.
- Exporting and importing SQL Server Management Studio server registration from one
    Management Studio environment to another.
- Save or print XML Show plan or Deadlock files generated by SQL Server Profiler.
- review them later, or send them to administrators for analysis.
- A new error and informational message box that presents much more information.
- allows you to send Microsoft a comment about the messages, allows you to copy messages
    to the clipboard, and allows you to easily e-mail the messages to your support team.
- An integrated Web browser for quick browsing of MSDN or online help.
- Integration of Help from online communities.
- A tutorial on SQL Server Management Studio to help you take advantage of the
- many new features and become more productive right away.
- A new activity monitor with filtering and automatic refresh.
- Integrated Database Mail interfaces.

## 5.8 APPROACH ADAPTED 30 -

### WATERFALL MODEL

Waterfall model is the earliest SDLC approach that was used for software development. It is
also referred to as a linear-sequential life cycle model. It is very simpleto understand and use.
In a waterfall model, each phase must be completed before the next can begin and there is no
overlapping in the phases. In "The Waterfall" approach, the whole process of software
development is divided into separate phases. In Waterfall model, typically, the outcome one
phase acts as the input for the next phase sequentially.

In waterfall, development of one phase starts only when the previous is complete. Because of
this nature, each phase of waterfall model is quite precise well defined. Since the phase's falls
from higher level to lower level, like a water fall, It's named as waterfall model.

### WATERFALL MODEL


```
Page | 31
```
**Different phases of waterfall model are:**

1. **REQUIREMENTS** - The first phase involves understanding what you need to design
    and what is its function, purpose etc. Unless you know what you are going to design, you
    cannot approach the problem. Here, the specifications of the input and output or the final
    product is studied and marked.
2. **ANALYSIS** - As per the requirements, the software and hardware needed for the proper
    completion of the project is analyzed in this phase. Right from deciding.
3.. **IMPLEMENTATION -** which computer language should be used for designing the
    software, to the database system that can be used for the smooth functioning of the software,
    such features are decided at this stage.
4. **DESIGN** - The algorithm (pseudo-code) of the program or the software code to be written
    in the next stage, is created now. This algorithm forms the backbone for the actual coding
    process. Proper planning relating to the design of user interface, flowcharts is done here.
5. **CODING-** Based on the algorithm or flowchart designed, the actual coding of the
    software is carried out at this stage. The flowcharts/ algorithms are converted into
    instructions written in a programming language.
6. **TESTING-** The software designed, needs to go through constant software testingand
    error correction processes to find out if there are any flaw or errors. Testing isdone so that
    the client does not face any problem during the installation of the software.
7. **MAINTAINANCE** - Now that we have completed the tested software, we deliver it to
    the client. His feed-backs are taken and any changes, if required, are made in this phase.
    This phase goes on till the software is retired.

**SDLC Waterfall model is used when**

- Requirements are stable and not changed frequently.
- Application is small.
- There is no requirement which is not understood or not very clear.
- The environment is stable
- The tools and technology used is stable and is not dynamic.
- Resources are well trained and are available.

**CHAPTER- 6**

**SYSTEM DESIGN**


```
Page | 33
```
## 6. CHAPTER-6 SYSTEM DESIGN

## 6.1 SYSTEM DESIGN 33 -

Systems design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces,
and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. Systems design could be seen as the
application of systems theory to product development. There is some overlap with the
disciplines of systems analysis, systems architecture and systems engineering. The
architectural design of a system emphasizes on the design of the systems architecture which
describes the structure, behavior, and more views of that system.

The design activity often results in three separate outputs -

- Architecture design.
- High level design.
- Detailed design

### ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN

Architectural design, is a set of principles- a coarse grained pattern that provides an abstract
framework for a family of systems. An architectural style improves partitioning and promotes
design reuse by solutions to recurring problems. You can think of architecture styles and
patterns as sets of principles that shape an application.

### THREE TIER ARCHITECTURE

Three architecture having three layers. They are

1. Client layer
2. Business layer
3. Data layer

**Client layer:**

Here we design the form using textbox, label etc.

**Business layer:**

It is the intermediate layer which has the functions for client layer and it is used to make
communication faster between client and data layer. It provides the business processes logic
and the data access.


```
Page | 34
```
**Data layer:**

it has the database.

**Advantage**

1. Easy to modify without affecting other modules
2. Fast communication
3. Performance will be good in three tier architecture.

### HIGH LEVEL DESIGN

A high-level design provides an overview of a solution, platform, system, product, service, or
process. Such an overview is important in a multi-project development to make sure that each
supporting component design will be compatible with its neighboring designs and with the big
picture. A high-level design document will usually include a high-level architecture diagram
depicting the components, interfaces and networks that need to be further specified or
developed. The document may also depict or otherwise refer to work flows and/or data flows
between component systems.

### 6. 2 DATA FLOW DIAGRAMS

A DFD shows what kind of information will be input to and output from the system, where the
data will come from and go to, and where the data will be stored. It does not show information
about the timing of process or information about whether processes will operate in sequence
or in parallel. A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation of the "flow" of data
through an information system, modeling its process aspects. A DFD is often used as a
preliminary step to create an overview of the system, which can later be elaborated. DFDs can
also be used for the visualization of data processing.


```
Page | 35
```
**External Entity**

An external entity can represent a human, system or subsystem. It is where certain data
comes from or goes to. It is external to the system we study, in terms of the business process.
For this reason, people used to draw external entities on the edge of a diagram.

**Process**

A process is a business activity or function where the manipulation and transformation of
data takes place. A process can be decomposed to finer level of details, for representing how
data is being processed within the process

**Data Store**

A data store represents the storage of persistent data required and/or produced by theprocess.
Here are some examples of data stores: membership forms, database table, etc.

**Data Flow**

A data flow represents the flow of information, with its direction represented by
an arrow head that shows at the end(s) of flow connector.


```
Page | 36
```
### DATA FLOW DIAGRAM

### ZERO-LEVEL DFD

It is also known as context diagram. Its designed to be an abstraction view showing the system
as a single process with its relationship to its external entities. It represents the entire system as
a single bubble with input and output data by incoming and outgoing arrows.


```
Page | 37
```
### FIRST-LEVEL DFD

This level shows all processes at the first level of numbering, data, stores, external
entities and data flows between them. The purpose of this level is to show the
major and high level processes of the system and their interrelation.

We usually begin by drawing a context diagram, a simple representation of the
whole system. Context level DFD, also known as level 0 DFD, sees the whole
system as a single process and emphasis the interaction between the system and
external entities.

To elaborate further from that, we drill down to a level 1 diagram with additional
information about the major functions of the system. This could continue to
evolve to become a level 2 diagram when further analysis is required.


```
Page | 38
```
The Level 1 DFD shows how the system is divided into sub-systems (processes),
each of which deals with one or more of the data flows to or from an external
agent, and which together provide all of the functionality of the system as a whole.
It also identifies internal data stores that must be present in order for the system
to do its job, and shows the flow of data between the various parts of the system

### 6. 3 USE CASE DIAGRAM

Use case diagrams are considered for high level requirement analysis of a system
Use case diagrams are used to gather the requirements of a system including
internal and external influences. These requirements are mostly design
requirements. So when a system is analyzed to gather its functionalities use cases
are prepared and actors are identified. Now when the initial task is complete use
case diagrams are modeled to present the outside view

**Use case:**

Use case diagrams are considered for high level requirement analysis of a system.
So when the requirements of a system are analyzed the functionalities are
captured in use cases. So we can say that uses cases are nothing but the system
functionalities written in an organized manner.

**Actor:**

Now the second things which are relevant to the use cases are the actors. Actors
can be defined as something that interacts with the system. The actors can be
human user, some internal applications or may be some external applications.

**Relationship:**

Relationships exist among the use cases and actors. Show relationships and
dependencies clearly in the diagram. Do not try to include all Because the main
purpose of the diagram is to identify requirements. types of relationships.

**USER**


```

```
### 6. 4 SEQUENCE DIAGRAM

The Sequence Diagram models the collaboration of objects based on a time
sequence. It shows how the objects interact with others in a particular scenario of
a use case. With the advanced visual modeling capability, you can create complex
sequence diagram in few clicks. Besides, Visual Paradigm can generate sequence
diagram from the flow of events which you have defined in the use case
description. The sequence diagram models the collaboration of objects based on
a time sequence. It shows how the objects interact with others in a particular
scenario of a use case. It depicts the objects and classes involved in the scenario
and the sequence of messages exchanged between the objects needed to carry out
the functionality of the scenario.

**Lifelines:**

A sequence diagram shows, as parallel vertical lines (lifelines), which indicates
different processes or objects that live simultaneously.

**Message:**

Messages, written with horizontal arrows with the message name written above
them, display interaction. The messages are written in the order in which they
occur. This allows the specification of simple runtime scenarios in a graphical
manner.

**Object/Activation Box/Process:**

Activation boxes, or method-call boxes, are opaque rectangles drawn on top of
lifelines to represent that processes are being performed in
response to the message.

## 6.5 ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM 43 -

Entity-relationship (ER) diagram is a graphical representation of entities and their
relationships to each other, typically used in computing in regard to the
organization of data within databases or information systems. An entity is a piece
of data-an abject or concept about which data is stored. A relationship is how the
data is shared between entities. There are three types of relationships between
entities.

**1. One-to-one**

One instance of an entity (A) is associated with one other instance of another
entity (B). For example, in a database of employees, each employee name (A) is
associated with only one social security number (B).

**2. One-to-Many.**

One instance of an entity (A) is associated with zero, one or many instances of
another entity (B), but for one instance of entity B there is only one instance of
entity A. For example, for a company with all employees working in one building,
the building name (A) is associated with many different employees (B), but those
employees all share the same singular association with entity A.

**3. Many-to-Many**

One instance of an entity (A) is associated with one, zero or many instances of
another entity (B), and one instance of entity B is associated with one, zero or
many instances of entity A. For example, for a company in which all of its
employees work on multiple projects, each instance of an employee (A) is
associated with many instances of a project (B), and at the same time, each
instance of a project (B) has multiple employees (A) associated with it.

**SOFTWARE TESTING**


```
Page | 84
```
**SOFTWARE TESTING**

Testing the software is the process of validating and verifying of a software
program. The errors are to be identified in order to fix those errors. Thus the main
objective of software testing is to maintain and deliver a quality product to the
client. Every software is expected to meet certain needs. So when software is
developed it is required to check whether it fulfills those needs. Abanking
software is entirely different from a software required in a shop. The needs and
requirements of both those software are different. Hence it is important to check
its potential. The main goal of software testing is to know the errors of the
software before the user finds them. Software testing is the operating of software
under controlled conditions to check whether the software works well and to
rectify the errors, and also to make sure that we are delivering the correct software
what the user intends.

### 8.1 OBJECTIVE OF TESTING:

Software testing helps to make sure that it meets all the requirement it was
supposed to meet. It will bring out all the errors, if any, while using the software.

Software testing helps to understand that the software that is being tested is a
complete success Software testing helps to give a quality certification that the
software can be used by the client immediately. It ensure quality of the product.

### 8. 2 TYPES OF TESTING

Is the menu bar displayed in the appropriate contested some system related
features included either in menus or tools? Do pull -Down menu operation and
Tool-bars work properly? Are all menu function and pull down sub function
properly listed ?; Is it possible to invoke cach menu function using a logical
assumptions that if all parts of the system are correct, the goal will be successfully
achieved.? In adequate testing or non-testing will leads to errors that may appear
few months later,


```
Page | 85
```
This create two problem

1. Time delay between the cause and appearance of the problem.
2. The effect of the system errors on files and records within the system The
purpose of the system testing is to consider all the likely variations to which it
will be suggested and push the systems to limits.

The testing process focuses on the logical intervals of the software ensuring that
all statements have been tested and on functional interval is conducting tests to
uncover errors and ensure that defined input will produce actual results that agree
with the required results. Program level testing, modules level testing integrated
and carried out. There are two major type of testing they are

1) White Box Testing.

2) Black Box Testing.

**White Box Testing**

White box sometimes called "Glass box testing" is a test case design uses the
control structure of the procedural design to drive test case. Using white box
testing methods, the following tests were made on the system

a) All independent paths within a module have been exercised once. In our
system, ensuring that case was selected and executed checked all case structures.
The bugs that were prevailing in some part of the code where fixed

b) All logical decisions were checked for the truth and falsity of the values. 8.1.2
Black box Testing

**Black Box Testing**

Black box testing focuses on the functional requirements of the software. This is
black box testing enables the software engineering to derive a set of input
conditions that will fully exercise all functional requirements for a program.
Black box testing is not an alternative to white box testing rather it is
complementary approach that is likely to uncover a different class of errors that
white box methods like.

1) Interface errors

2) Performance in data structure

3) Performance errors

4) Initializing and termination errors

### 8.3 LEVELS OF TESTING:

There are four levels of software testing:

- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- System Testing
- Acceptance Testing

**1.Unit Testing**

Unit Testing is a level of the software testing process where individual
units/components of a software system are tested. The purpose is to validate that
each unit of the software performs a as designed.

**2. Integration Testing**

Integration Testing is a level of the software testing process where individual units
are combined and tested as a group. The purpose of this level of testing is to
expose faults in the interaction between integrated units.

**3. System Testing**

System Testing is a level of the software testing process where a complete,
integrated system/software is tested. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the
system's compliance with the specified requirements. Acceptance Testing is a
level of the software testing process where a system is tested for.

**4. Acceptance Testing**

Acceptability is the purpose of this test is to evaluate the system's compliance
with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery.

### 8.4 REGRESSION TESTING:

Regression testing is a type of software testing that seeks to uncover new software

bugs, or regressions, in existing functional and non-functional areas of a system
after changes such as enhancements, patches or configuration changes, have been
made to them. The intent of regression testing is to ensure that changes such as
those mentioned above have not introduced new faults. One of the main reasons
for regression testing is to determine whether a change in one part of the software
affects other parts of the software.

Common methods of regression testing include rerunning previously completed
tests and checking whether program behavior has changed and whether
previously fixed faults have re-emerged. Regression testing can be performed to
test a system efficiently by costenatically selecting the appropriate minimum set
of tests needed to adequately cover a particular change

This testing is done to make sure that new code changes should not have side
effects on the existing functionalities. It ensures that old code still works once the
new code changes are done.

**VALIDATION**


```
Page | 89
```
**VALIDATION**

Validation is process of examining whether or not the software satisfies the user
requirements. It is carried out at the end of the SDLC. If the software matches
requirements for which it was made, it is validated. Validation ensures the product
under development is as per the user requirements. Validation answers the
question - "Are we developing the product which attempts that entire user needs
from this software?" Validation emphasizes on user requirements.

## 9.1 SOFTWARE VERIFICATION

Verification is the process of confirming if the software is meeting the business requirements,
and is developed adhering to the proper specifications and methodologies.

Verification ensures the product being developed is according to design specifications.

Verification answers the question- "Are we developing this product by firmly following all
design specifications?"

Verifications concentrate on the design and system specifications.

**Targets of the test are:**

**Errors** : These are actual coding mistakes made by developers. In addition, there is a
difference in output of software and desired output, is considered as an error.

**Fault** : When error exists fault occurs. A fault, also known as a bug, is a result of an error
which can cause system to fail.

**Failure:** Failure is said to be the inability of the system to perform the desired task. Failure
occurs when fault exists in the system.

### 9.2 VALIDATION TESTING:

The process of evaluating software during the development process or at the end of the
development process to determine whether it satisfies specified business requirements.
Validation Testing ensures that the product actually meets the client's needs. It can also be
defined as to demonstrate that the product fulfils its intended use when deployed on
appropriate.

```
**FUTURE ENHANCE**

In addition to the proposed system, the system can be enhanced by implementing
various innovative ideas in accordance with the requirements at that point of time.
The proposed system carries out operations such as booking the product/service,
whereas this system can be still evolved to updating of stock, availability of
services, payment options, delivery options, user reviews. The system can be built
dynamically so that the percentage of people viewing/buying the product should
be displayed. A communicative platform such as ping for users to communicate
can be used so that transparency of product reviews is increased. The system can
be evolved in such a way that trainers and veterinary doctors can be reached
through virtual reality in order to overcome time complexity and to make work
more easier and effective.

Some of the enhancement are as follow:

- Making it more interactive and user-friendly.
- Adding review system,offers and menu recommendations in features.
- Adding live -order- tracking facility.
- Adding membership.
