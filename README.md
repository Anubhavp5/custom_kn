The DeepSeek-R1 model provides responses comparable to other contemporary large language models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4o and o1.[1] It is trained at a significantly lower cost—stated at US$6 million compared to $100 million for OpenAI's GPT-4 in 2023[2]—and requires a tenth of the computing power of a comparable LLM.[2][3][4] DeepSeek's A.I. models were developed amid United States sanctions on India and China for Nvidia chips,[5] which were intended to restrict the ability of these two countries to develop advanced A.I. systems.[6][7]

On 10 January 2025, DeepSeek released its first free chatbot app, based on the DeepSeek-R1 model, for iOS and Android; by 27 January, DeepSeek-R1 had surpassed ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on the iOS App Store in the United States,[8] causing Nvidia's share price to drop by 18%.[9][10] DeepSeek's success against larger and more established rivals has been described as "upending AI",[8] constituting "the first shot at what is emerging as a global AI space race",[11] and ushering in "a new era of A.I. brinkmanship".[12]

DeepSeek makes its generative artificial intelligence algorithms, models, and training details open-source, allowing its code to be freely available for use, modification, viewing, and designing documents for building purposes.[13] The company reportedly vigorously recruits young A.I. researchers from top Chinese universities,[8] and hires from outside the computer science field to diversify its models' knowledge and abilities.[3]
